<p>Give me a computer, I will die in peace, LOL.</p>

<p>If you see someone walking like crazy in some random trails, that might
be me.</p>

<p>If you see someone looking at a dumb tree for 30 minutes with a camera,
that may also be me.</p>

<p>Not everyone knows his/her destiny, but one can enjoy everything he/she
went through before find out destiny.</p>

<p>Or just focusing on a skill and see how good you can be after years over years
practise.</p>
